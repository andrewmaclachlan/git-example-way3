abstract = {Urban heat island and global warming increase significantly the ambient temperature. Higher temperatures have a serious impact on the electricity consumption of the building sector increasing considerably the peak and the total electricity demand. The present paper aims to collect, analyze and present in a comparative way existing studies investigating the impact of ambient temperature increase on electricity consumption. Analysis of eleven studies dealing with the impact of the ambient temperature on the peak electricity demand showed that for each degree of temperature increase, the increase of the peak electricity load varies between 0.45{\%} and 4.6{\%}. This corresponds to an additional electricity penalty of about 21 (±10.4) W per degree of temperature increase and per person. In parallel, analysis of fifteen studies examining the impact of ambient temperature on the total electricity consumption, showed that the actual increase of the electricity demand per degree of temperature increase varies between 0.5{\%} and 8.5{\%}.},

Applications are presented to illustrate UMEP's potential in the identification of heat waves and cold waves; the impact of green infrastructure on runoff; the effects of buildings on human thermal stress; solar energy production; and the impact of human activities on heat emissions. UMEP has broad utility for applications related to outdoor thermal comfort, wind, urban energy consumption and climate change mitigation. It includes tools to enable users to input atmospheric and surface data from multiple sources, to characterise the urban environment, to prepare meteorological data for use in cities, to undertake simulations and consider scenarios, and to compare and visualise different combinations of climate indicators. An open-source tool, UMEP is designed to be easily updated as new data and tools are developed, and to be accessible to researchers, decision-makers and practitioners.},

@article{Holst2011,
abstract = {This study deals with a current problem of urban human-biometeorology on the micro-scale, which becomes more important due to the future increase of severe summer heat in Central Europe. The impact of street design parameters on the thermal comfort of citizens is analysed in an experimental way for typical summer conditions in Central Europe. The investigation is focused on the behaviour of mean radiant temperature T mrt and physiologically equivalent temperature PET as the most important human-biometeorological variables for thermal comfort during these atmospheric conditions. To get quantitative results on how they depend on small-scale characteristics of urban street canyons, an investigation design is applied which is based on measurements of relevant meteorological variables - like air temperature T a - by specific humanbiometeorological measuring systems. They were conducted in selected street canyons within different urban quarters of Freiburg, the warmest city in Germany, from 2007-2009. T mrt and PET were calculated from the measured meteorological variables by well-tested approaches. The geometry of urban street canyons is characterised by (i) the sky view factor SVF determined from fish-eye photos, (ii) the ratio of building height H to street width W, (iii) the orientation to the sun, and (iv) the fraction of ctc (coverage by the street tree canopy). To eliminate the influence of slightly different weather conditions even on typical summer days, the results are not presented in form of absolute values for the human-biometeorological variables, but in form of ratios for the measured radiative flux densities and in form of differences for the measured and calculated temperatures. As the results for T mrt and PET should primarily quantify universal patterns of the impact of street design parameters on human thermal comfort, they are only presented as mean values for the period 10-16 CET. The main results obtained from different analyses are: (i) SVF for the southern half of the upper hemisphere (SVF 90-270) is more suitable to characterise the sites with respect to the thermal perception of citizens than SVF for the whole upper hemisphere (SVF 1-360), (ii) in contrast to wide E-W oriented street canyons, narrow E-W oriented street canyons have larger spatial differences in T a, T mrt and PET, (iii) with respect to the orientation, these differences are larger in E-W than in N-S oriented street canyons, and (iv) an increase of ctc by 10 {\%} leads to a decrease of T a by only 0.2 °C, but to a reduction of T mrt by 3.6 °C and of PET by 1.4 °C. {\textcopyright} Gebr{\"{u}}der Borntraeger, Stuttgart 2011.},

abstract = {The uncertainties associated with global climate models pose substantial hurdles for urban water planning. Despite growing consensus among climatologists that the American Southwest is headed for a warmer and drier future, water planners in metropolitan Phoenix and elsewhere are reluctant to consider long-term climate change as a significant factor in increased risk of future water scarcity. A new paradigm for climate research and water planning is needed—one that is based on an assumption of uncertainty and a vision of multiple plausible futures, managing risk, and adaptive behaviors. To this end, we downscaled global climate models from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third and Fourth Assessment Reports for the watersheds north of Phoenix and estimated changes in runoff using a hydrological model. Results then were used as inputs to WaterSim, an integrated simulation model of water supply and demand in Phoenix. The model simulated “what if” scenarios under varying policy decisions and future climates. Results of simulation experiments suggest that (1) current levels of per capita water consumption cannot be supported without unsustainable groundwater use under most climate model scenarios, (2) feasible reductions in residential water consumption allow the region to weather the most pessimistic of the climate projections, (3) delaying action reduces long-term sustainability of the groundwater resource under some climate scenarios, and (4) adaptive policy with appropriate monitoring to track groundwater provides warning that the need for use restrictions is approaching and avoids the need for drastic, ad hoc actions.

abstract = {By 2050, an estimated 6.3 billion people will inhabit the world's towns and cities -- an increase of 3.5 billion from 2010. Our planet will have undergone the largest and fastest period of urban expansion in human history. The area directly transformed in the next four decades will be roughly the size of South Africa, and the new demands of cities will reshape most landscapes, both built and natural. Urban growth will have significant impacts on biodiversity, natural habitats and many ecosystem services that society relies on. The challenges of urbanization are profound, but so too are the opportunities. The outcome of the Rio+20 UN Conference on Sustainable Development emphasizes that “if they are well planned and developed, including through integrated planning and management approaches, cities can promote economically, socially and environmentally sustainable societies.” Well-designed cities can sustainably accommodate large numbers of people in a relatively small amount of space, offering improved quality of life and allowing for greater resource efficiency and the preservation of larger intact natural areas. The Cities and Biodiversity Outlook combines science and policy in a global assessment of the links between urbanization, biodiversity and ecosystem services. It showcases best practices and provides key advice on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. The principal message is that urban areas must offer better stewardship of the ecosystems on which they rely, including by generating multiple ecosystem services through design and restoration and reducing their environmental impact through improved efficiency of material and energy use and by making productive use of waste. Cities can reconcile human society and biodiversity by creating environments that are ecologically sustainable, economically productive, socially just, politically participatory and culturally vibrant. I commend this study to policy-makers, planners and all who have a stake in creating ecologically sustainable urbanization for the benefit of humanity and the planet.},

abstract = {Vegetation and building morphology characteristics are investigated at 19 sites on a north-south LiDAR transect across the megacity of London. Local maxima of mean building height and building plan area density at the city centre are evident. Surprisingly, the mean vegetation height (zv3) is also found to be highest in the city centre. From the LiDAR data various morphological parameters are derived as well as shadow patterns. Continuous images of the effects of buildings and of buildings plus vegetationon sky view factor (=) are derived. A general reduction of = is found, indicating the importance of including vegetation when deriving = in urban areas. The contribution of vegetation to the shadowing at ground level is higher during summer than in autumn. Using these 3D data the influence on urban climate and mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) is calculated with SOLWEIG. The results from these simulations highlight that vegetation can be most effective at reducing heat stress within dense urban environments in summer. The daytime average Tmrt is found to be lowest in the densest urban environments due to shadowing; foremost from buildings but also from trees. It is clearly shown that this method could be used to quantify the influence of vegetation on Tmrt within the urban environment. The results presented in this paper highlight a number of possible climate sensitive planning practices for urban areas at the local scale (i.e. 102-5×103 m).},

High resolution digital surface models (DSMs) are used to describe the urban geometry and additional DSMs including 3D vegetation structures can also be incorporated. Inclusion of vegetation is shown to be essential when modelling irradiances for wall surfaces within the urban environment.

abstract = {Background A growing number of quantitative studies have investigated the potential benefits of outdoor blue spaces (lakes, rivers, sea, etc) and human health, but there is not yet a systematic review synthesizing this evidence. Objectives To systematically review the current quantitative evidence on human health and well-being benefits of outdoor blue spaces. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analysis, observational and experimental quantitative studies focusing on both residential and non-residential outdoor blue space exposure were searched using specific keywords. Results In total 35 studies were included in the current systematic review, most of them being classified as of “good quality” (N = 22). The balance of evidence suggested a positive association between greater exposure to outdoor blue spaces and both benefits to mental health and well-being (N = 12 studies) and levels of physical activity (N = 13 studies). The evidence of an association between outdoor blue space exposure and general health (N = 6 studies), obesity (N = 8 studies) and cardiovascular (N = 4 studies) and related outcomes was less consistent. Conclusions Although encouraging, there remains relatively few studies and a large degree of heterogeneity in terms of study design, exposure metrics and outcome measures, making synthesis difficult. Further research is needed using longitudinal research and natural experiments, preferably across a broader range of countries, to better understand the causal associations between blue spaces, health and wellbeing.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Episode analyses of heat waves have documented a comparatively higher impact on mortality than on morbidity (hospital admissions) in European cities. The evidence from daily time series studies is scarce and inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of high environmental temperatures on hospital admissions during April to September in 12 European cities participating in the Assessment and Prevention of Acute Health Effects of Weather Conditions in Europe (PHEWE) project. METHODS: For each city, time series analysis was used to model the relationship between maximum apparent temperature (lag 0-3 days) and daily hospital admissions for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory causes by age (all ages, 65-74 age group, and 75+ age group), and the city-specific estimates were pooled for two geographical groupings of cities. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: For respiratory admissions, there was a positive association that was heterogeneous between cities. For a 1 degrees C increase in maximum apparent temperature above a threshold, respiratory admissions increased by +4.5{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.9-7.3) and +3.1{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.8-5.5) in the 75+ age group in Mediterranean and North-Continental cities, respectively. In contrast, the association between temperature and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular admissions tended to be negative and did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: High temperatures have a specific impact on respiratory admissions, particularly in the elderly population, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Why high temperature increases cardiovascular mortality but not cardiovascular admissions is also unclear. The impact of extreme heat events on respiratory admissions is expected to increase in European cities as a result of global warming and progressive population aging.},

abstract = {Future anthropogenic climate change is likely to increase the air temperature (T a ) across Europe and increase the frequency, duration and magnitude of severe heat stress events. Heat stress events are generally associated with clear-sky conditions and high T a , which give rise to high radiant heat load, i.e. mean radiant temperature (T mrt ). In urban environments, T mrt is strongly influenced by urban geometry. The present study examines the effect of urban geometry on daytime heat stress in three European cities (Gothenburg in Sweden, Frankfurt in Germany and Porto in Portugal) under present and future climates, using T mrt as an indicator of heat stress. It is found that severe heat stress occurs in all three cities. Similar maximum daytime T mrt is found in open areas in all three cities despite of the latitudinal differences in average daytime T mrt . In contrast, dense urban structures like narrow street canyons are able to mitigate heat stress in the summer, without causing substantial changes in T mrt in the winter. Although the T mrt averages are similar for the north-south and east-west street canyons in each city, the number of hours when T mrt exceeds the threshold values of 55.5 and 59.4 °C-used as indicators of moderate and severe heat stress-in the north-south canyons is much higher than that in the east-west canyons. Using statistically downscaled data from a regional climate model, it is found that the study sites were generally warmer in the future scenario, especially Porto, which would further exacerbate heat stress in urban areas. However, a decrease in solar radiation in Gothenburg and Frankfurt reduces T mrt in the spring, while the reduction in T mrt is somewhat offset by increasing T a in other seasons. It suggests that changes in the T mrt under the future scenario are dominated by variations in T a . Nonetheless, the intra-urban differences remain relatively stable in the future. These findings suggest that dense urban structure can reduce daytime heat stress since it reduces the number of hours of high T mrt in the summer and does not cause substantial changes in average and minimum T mrt in the winter. In dense urban settings, a more diverse urban thermal environment is also preferred to compensate for reduced solar access in the winter. The extent to which the urban geometry can be optimized for the future climate is also influenced by local urban characteristics.},

Few population level studies have examined the relationships between green space and mental health. Further, few studies have considered the role of green space in non-urban settings. This study contributes a population-level perspective from the United States to examine the relationship between environmental green space 
and mental health outcomes in a study area that includes a spectrum of urban to rural environments. Multivariate survey regression analyses examine the association between green space and mental health using the unique, population-based Survey of the Health of Wisconsin database. Analyses were adjusted for length of residence in the neighborhood to reduce the impact of neighborhood selection bias. Higher levels of neighborhood green space were associated with significantly lower levels of symptomology for depression, anxiety and stress, after controlling for a wide range of confounding factors. Results suggest that “greening” could be a potential population mental health improvement strategy in the United States.},

abstract = {The mean radiant temperature, T(mrt), which sums up all shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes (both direct and reflected) to which the human body is exposed is one of the key meteorological parameters governing human energy balance and the thermal comfort of man. In this paper, a new radiation model (SOLWEIG 1.0), which simulates spatial variations of 3D radiation fluxes and T(mrt) in complex urban settings, is presented. The T(mrt) is derived by modelling shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes in six directions (upward, downward and from the four cardinal points) and angular factors. The model requires a limited number of inputs, such as direct, diffuse and global shortwave radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, urban geometry and geographical information (latitude, longitude and elevation). The model was evaluated using 7 days of integral radiation measurements at two sites with different building geometries--a large square and a small courtyard in G{\"{o}}teborg, Sweden (57 degrees N)--across different seasons and in various weather conditions. The evaluation reveals good agreement between modelled and measured values of T(mrt), with an overall good correspondence of R (2) = 0.94, (p {\textless} 0.01, RMSE = 4.8 K). SOLWEIG 1.0 is still under development. Future work will incorporate a vegetation scheme, as well as an improvement of the estimation of fluxes from the four cardinal points.},

abstract = {SUMMARY ERA-40 is a re-analysis of meteorological observations from September 1957 to August 2002 produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in collaboration with many institutions. The observing system changed considerably over this re-analysis period, with assimilable data provided by a succession of satellite-borne instruments from the 1970s onwards, supplemented by increasing numbers of observations from aircraft, ocean-buoys and other surface platforms, but with a declining number of radiosonde ascents since the late 1980s. The observations used in ERA-40 were accumulated from many sources. The first part of this paper describes the data acquisition and the principal changes in data type and coverage over the period. It also describes the data assimilation system used for ERA-40. This benefited from many of the changes introduced into operational forecasting since the mid-1990s, when the systems used for the 15-year ECMWF re-analysis (ERA-15) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) re-analysis were implemented. Several of the improvements are discussed. General aspects of the production of the analyses are also summarized. A number of results indicative of the overall performance of the data assimilation system, and implicitly of the observing system, are presented and discussed. The comparison of background (short-range) forecasts and analyses with observations, the consistency of the global mass budget, the magnitude of differences between analysis and background fields and the accuracy of medium-range forecasts run from the ERA-40 analyses are illustrated. Several results demonstrate the marked improvement that was made to the observing system for the * Corresponding author: European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, A. Rayner and R. W.

In contrast, the synoptic quality of the analysis for the northern hemisphere is sufficient to provide forecasts that remain skilful well into the medium range for all years. Two particular problems are also examined: excessive precipitation over tropical oceans and a too strong Brewer–Dobson circulation, both of which are pronounced in later years. Several other aspects of the quality of the re-analyses revealed by monitoring and validation studies are summarized. Expectations that the 'second-generation' ERA-40 re-analysis would provide products that are better than those from the first-generation ERA-15 and NCEP/NCAR re-analyses are found to have been met in most cases.},

abstract = {The extent of the surface area sunlit is critical for radiative energy exchanges and therefore for a wide range of applications that require urban land surface models (ULSM), ranging from human comfort to weather forecasting. Here a computationally demanding shadow casting algorithm is used to assess the capability of a simple single-layer urban canopy model, which assumes an infinitely long rotating canyon (ILC), to reproduce sunlit areas on roofs, walls and roads over central London. Results indicate that the sunlit road areas are well-represented but somewhat smaller using an ILC, while sunlit roofs areas are consistently larger, especially for dense urban areas. The largest deviations from real world sunlit areas are for roofs during mornings and evenings. Sunlit fractions on walls are overestimated using an ILC during mornings and evenings are found. The implications of these errors are dependent on the application targeted. For example, (independent of albedo) ULSMs used in numerical weather prediction applying ILC representation of the urban form will overestimate outgoing shortwave radiation from roofs due to the overestimation of sunlit fraction of the roofs. Complications of deriving height to width ratios from real world data are also discussed.},

abstract = {Outdoor thermal comfort has been a widely concerned issue in tropical and subtropical cities. In order to assess the conditions of outdoor thermal comfort, quantitative information on different spatial and temporal scales is required. This paper employs a numerical model (SOLWEIG - SOlar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry) to examine the spatial and temporal variations of mean radiant temperature (Tmrt), as an indicator of radiant heat load and outdoor heat stress in high-density sub-tropical urban environment in summer. The SOLWEIG model is found to simulate the six-directional shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes as well as Tmrtvery well. Simulation results show that urban geometry plays an important role in intra-urban differences in summer daytime Tmrt. Open areas are generally warmer than surrounding narrow street canyons. Street canyons are sheltered from incoming direct solar radiation by shading of buildings while open areas are exposed to intense solar radiation, especially along the sunlit walls where high Tmrtis observed due to reflected short-wave radiation and long-wave radiation emitted from the sunlit building walls. The present study confirms that there are great potential in using urban geometry to mitigate high radiant heat load and daytime heat stress in the compacted urban environment. In high-density subtropical cities where high daytime Tmrtcauses severe thermal discomfort in summer, dense urban structures are able to mitigate the extremely high Tmrtand improve outdoor thermal comfort. However, the shading strategy has to be cautious about air ventilation in such a dense urban environment.},

In the 2008/2009 summer, for example, many more lives were lost to heatwaves than to that summer's bushfires which were among the worst in the history of the Australian nation. For many years, these other forms of natural disaster have received much greater public attention than heatwaves, although there are some signs of change. We propose a new index, called the excess heat factor (EHF) for use in Australian heatwave monitoring and forecasting. The index is based on a three-day-averaged daily mean temperature (DMT), and is intended to capture heatwave intensity as it applies to human health outcomes, although its usefulness is likely to be much broader and with potential for international applicability. The index is described and placed in a climatological context in order to derive heatwave severity. Heatwave severity, as characterised by the climatological distribution of heatwave intensity, has been used to normalise the climatological variation in heatwave intensity range across Australia. This methodology was used to introduce a pilot national heatwave forecasting service for Australia during the 2013/2014 summer. Some results on the performance of the service are presented.{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The morphology of Como Beach in the Swan River Estuary, Western Australia, is described. Como Beach is in a microtidal estuarine environment in which modal wave conditions are extremely low and nontidal fluctuations in water level are principally determined by storm surges and low-frequency changes in ocean water levels. Detailed descriptions of sandy beaches in very sheltered locations, such as Como, are uncommon in the literature, although these beaches are a common feature of coastal environments. In contrast to beaches in wave-dominated environments, those in very sheltered, low-energy locations may support subtidal terraces and beach profiles that differ in form and scale from the bars and intertidal flats in wave- and tide-dominated environments. At Como, beach profiles are superimposed on a subtidal terrace rising steeply from waters several metres deep to -1.5 m (Australian Height Datum; AHD), then with a low gradient to approximately -0.3 m (AHD) at the shore. The profiles range from planar forms on which very small waves (H, less than 0.1 m) are dissipated to curvilinear forms that reflect higher waves (H(b) {\textgreater} 0.2 m) from the beachface. A transitional form with a segmented profile comprising a steep beachface and flat inshore occurs, particularly where littoral drift is apparent.},

In this study, the SOLWEIG model (SOlar and Long Wave Environmental Irradiance Geometry) was employed to investigate the spatial variation of Tmrtin different urban settings in Shanghai. The model was tested against six directional radiant flux density measurements and showed good performance in Shanghai's urban environment. Two different urban settings with different building geometry and vegetation cover were used as case study sites. A typical heat wave day in 2013 was selected to investigate the daytime radiant heat stress intensity. Spatial analysis modules were developed and the Radiant Heat Stress Intensity index was defined. The study reveals that in Shanghai under heat waves the heat stress induced by the thermal radiant environment is quite severe, with Tmrtcommonly well above 60 °C in daytime, and intra-urban Tmrtdifferences are largely influenced by building density and height, street orientation and vegetation. Open paved spaces and space near sunlit walls are the places that have the highest Tmrt. The study shows that the spatial variation of Tmrtcan be used to identify thermally vulnerable areas and hotspots in complex urban environment, and provide implications for urban design towards the mitigation of heat stress in high-density cities.},

We discuss the specifics of how changes in the reanalysis and processing have led to improvement over the WFD. We attribute improvements in precipitation and wind speed to the latest reanalysis basis data and improved downward shortwave fluxes to the changes in the aerosol corrections. Covering 1979–2012, the WFDEI will allow more thorough comparisons of hydrological and Earth System model outputs with hydrologically and phenologically relevant satellite products than using the WFD.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new method to calculate sky view factors (SVFs) from high resolution urban digital elevation models using a shadow casting algorithm. By utilizing weighted annuli to derive SVF from hemispherical images, the distance light source positions can be predefined and uniformly spread over the whole hemisphere, whereas another method applies a random set of light source positions with a cosine-weighted distribution of sun altitude angles. The 2 methods have similar results based on a large number of SVF images. However, when comparing variations at pixel level between an image generated using the new method presented in this paper with the image from the random method, anisotropic patterns occur. The absolute mean difference between the 2 methods is 0.002 ranging up to 0.040. The maximum difference can be as much as 0.122. Since SVF is a geometrically derived parameter, the anisotropic errors created by the random method must be considered as significant. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2010.},

@article{Goodwin2009,
abstract = {Urban and landscape planners are becoming increasingly aware of the potential of light detection and ranging (lidar) technology to produce height and structural information over large geographic areas in both an economic and time-efficient fashion. In urban environments where the structural complexity is high, for example, lidar is seen as a critical and innovative dataset to improve the characterization of both vegetation and building attributes. Using a small-footprint, first- and last-return lidar dataset of Vancouver, Canada, we demonstrate the potential to derive a suite of attributes important for describing the interactions of the urban surface and atmosphere in weather forecasting, air pollution, and urban dispersion modelling. Two levels of attributes were defined. First, primary attributes such as building shape, size, and location and tree classification were calculated. Building extent and size were computed using an object-based approach based on connectivity and height rules. The classification of tree crown areas was derived from the location of last-return data, filtered to remove the incidence of last returns caused by the interaction of the lidar beam with building edges, and height rules. Validation showed that building areas derived from lidar compared well with aerial photography estimates (r2 = 0.96, p {\textless} 0.001, n = 98). The percentage difference between estimates was equal to 16{\%} (n = 83) when buildings were discriminated from the surrounding features. However, the percentage difference between estimates increased to 35{\%} (n = 98) when commission errors were considered, as lidar often overestimated building areas due to closely spaced buildings (gaps less than 1–2 m) not being separated. Similarly, the height and area of lidar-extracted trees were highly correlated with field-based measurements (r2 = 0.84 and 0.76, respectively, p {\textless} 0.001, n = 50). Once these primary attributes were derived, we demonstrate the extraction of a number of secondary attributes including building mean height, normalized building volume, building wall surface area, and interelement spacing. Of significance, this research has shown that lidar can provide spatially detailed estimates of urban structure and cover which characterize the aerodynamic and energetic properties of urban areas.},
